#Developer Portfolio Site
This is my developer portfolio site I am going to host on Vercel to show off all my coding projects.

##Objectives
- Make main web page look like an old school DOS type start up screen.
- Make each project showcased look like an old video game title screen.
- Each project will be a snap element where you scroll and a whole new project will "snap" on the screen as if the game title switched
- Play around with sound effects
- Use node mailer api to send e-mails to myself using a contact form
- Create a Captcha test to keep people from spamming my inbox.
