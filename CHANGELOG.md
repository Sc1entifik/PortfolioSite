Created InvisibleMeasurementDiv functional component to separate concerns of an invisible measurement div from the landingPageHeader.tsx responsibilites. Added useCharCount.ts hook to calculate the number of border characters needed to add the border character across the screen. Adjusted font sizes for media query screen sizes in page.tsx so menu system looks consistent no matter the font size or screen layout.
