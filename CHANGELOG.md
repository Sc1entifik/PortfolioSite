##Versions
- v-0.0.1 - Initial commit. Added CHANGELOG.md modified README.md.
- v-0.1 - Installed custom font configured for tailwind and added colors. Added a Sitemap Enum to hold all the routes the website will have.
- v-0.1.5 - Created LandingPageHeader functional component which sizes the header based on number of ch and font size in rem. Created InvisibleMeasurementDiv functional component to separate concerns of an invisible measurement div from the landingPageHeader.tsx responsibilites. Added useCharCount.ts hook to calculate the number of border characters needed to add the border character across the screen. Adjusted font sizes for media query screen sizes in page.tsx so menu system looks consistent no matter the font size or screen layout.
- v-0.2 - Created hook to apply routing on pages on keydown presses.
- v-0.4 - Added projects route which looks like a game selection screen loads when user presses 2 from "Main Menu" landing page. Added a components folder to the projects route so that I can make the projects route render from composable components. Added components for handling Title and description rendering, project image rendering, and project resources rendering towards the bottom of the page.
- v-0.6 - Composed functional components making up projects route and added media queries so the site looks good on most screen sizes. I also added custom media queries to tailwind config file.
